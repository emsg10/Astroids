Astroids
========

The classic astroids game made in canvas.
main.js contains the javascript code and the canvas element is in the index file.
The game is up and running on http://www.student.bth.se/~emsg10/Jscript/AstroidsProjekt/.

You are free to use this code if you would like to run the game on your webserver.

Just take the canvas element from my index file and run main.js and you should be able to run the game.

Good Luck :)
